# Windows tools -- Roll Your Own Toolchain

## Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
We strongly recommend that you are using a 64-bit Windows 10. That way you can in most cases avoid the virtual machine and run native Linux command-line tools directly on Windows. This means you can use your own Windows files and don't have to bother transferring files to a virtual machine.

To install Windows Subsystem for Linux, [click here for Microsoft's own instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

After this you should look at the [Linux manual](linux.md).
